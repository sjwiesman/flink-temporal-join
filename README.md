Flink Temporal Enrichment Join
=======

An example Flink application for performing temporal enrichment join. A temporal join is one that takes time into account, this example uses currency conversions and gets the correct conversion for the rate as it was at a particular point in time. 

This project can be run inside of an ide (I have tested with intellij), see log output for web ui port.
